## Version Control

- Note:  Torch does not support python version 3.10 
[version control](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-from-pypi)
`-m pip install "SomeProject>=1,<2"`

## python -m run this module
[discussion of -m](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50821312/meaning-of-python-m-flag)

Your "default" version is 3.8. It's the first one appearing in your path. Therefore, when you type python3 (Linux or Mac) or python (Windows) in a shell you will start a 3.8 interpreter because that's the first Python executable that is found when traversing your path.

Suppose you are then starting a new project where you want to use Python 3.9. You create a virtual environment called .venv and activate it.

python3.9 -m venv .venv         # "py -3.9" on Windows
source .venv/bin/activate    # ".venv\Scripts\activate" on Windows 
We now have the virtual environment activated using Python 3.9. Typing python in a shell starts the 3.9 interpreter.

BUT, if you type

pip install <some-package>
Then what version of pip is used? Is it the pip for the default version, i.e. Python 3.8, or the Python version within the virtual environment?

An easy way to get around that ambiguity is simply to use

python -m pip install <some-package>
The -m flag makes sure that you are using the pip that's tied to the active Python

Tangentially, don't confuse the directory name . with the Bourne shell command which comprises a single dot (also known by its Bash alias source). The command


`. ./scriptname`
